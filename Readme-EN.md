There is only one difference: the tutorial above will ask you to download the zip file for the Pixiv Downloader. Instead, download the zip file for the Fanbox Downloader. You can download pixivfanboxDownloader.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/xuejianxianzun/PixivFanboxDownloader/releases) of this repository.

[Installing on Microsoft Edge Canary Browser](https://xuejianxianzun.github.io/PBDWiki/#/en/MicrosoftEdgeCanary)

There is only one difference: the tutorial above will ask you to download the crx file for the Pixiv Downloader. Instead, download the crx file for the Fanbox Downloader.

# How to Use

- After installing this extension, refresh the fanbox page. You will see a blue download button on the right side of the page. Click this button to start using it.
- Downloaded files will be saved in the browser's download directory. If you want to save them to a different location, you need to change the browser's download directory.
- Please disable the browser setting "Ask where to save each file before downloading" to avoid the save-as dialog during downloads.
- If the filename of the downloaded file is abnormal, please disable other browser extensions with download functions.
